   There are various eggs:
  
  | Name | Description |
  | :---- | ---- |
  | thnpc_spawn_egg | all characters |
  | thnpc_th6_spawn_egg | characters in TH06 |
  | gap_spawn_egg | gap (beautify your transporter with it!) |
   
**Step 2: Spawn**
  
  Right click the ground with spawn egg, we get an Aki sizuha.

  Right click Aki sizuha, it is as same as the vanilla NPC GUI, not much introduction.
